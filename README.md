# 🇨🇦 UNIT30 Records — Web App

**UNIT30 Records** is a purpose-built web application designed to serve as the digital backbone of the UNIT30 label ecosystem. It functions as a centralized platform for artist representation, releases, and identity—engineered with a focus on clarity, performance, and long-term scalability.

The application is built to treat a record label not as a static website, but as a living system. Content is structured, versionable, and intentionally minimal, allowing the music and the brand to remain the primary signal. Every component exists to support discoverability, consistency, and control over how **UNIT30 Records** presents itself on the web.

From an engineering standpoint, the project emphasizes:

- Clean, maintainable architecture
- Fast load times and predictable behavior
- A design language that prioritizes intent over trends
- Flexibility for future expansion without rewrites

This is not a marketing page stitched together with templates. It is an application that happens to exist on the web—built with the assumption that the label will grow, change, and outlive its first implementation.

**UNIT30 Records** operates independently. This app reflects that philosophy.
